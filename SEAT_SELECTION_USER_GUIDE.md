# Seat Selection User Guide

This guide explains how to select and manage your seat for LAN party events using CaLANdar.

## Overview

Once you've RSVP'd to an event, you can select a specific seat or choose an unspecified seat (if allowed by the event organizer). Your seat is linked to your attendance times, ensuring you only reserve a seat for when you'll actually be at the event.

## Prerequisites

Before you can select a seat:

1. **RSVP to the event** - You must RSVP as "Yes" or "Maybe"
2. **Select your attendance times** - Choose which time periods you'll attend
3. **Event must have seating configured** - The event organizer must have set up rooms and seats

## How to Select a Seat

### Step 1: Navigate to the Event Page

1. Log into CaLANdar
2. Click on the event you're attending from your dashboard
3. Scroll down past the event description, RSVP section, and attendees

### Step 2: Choose Your Seat

You'll see the "Seat Selection" section which shows:

- **Unspecified Seat Option** (if enabled): Click this button if you don't need a specific seat
- **Room Cards**: Each room shows available seats either as:
  - **Visual floorplan**: Seats overlaid on the room image
  - **List view**: Buttons for each seat by label (A1, A2, etc.)

### Step 3: Understanding Seat Status

Seats are color-coded for easy identification:

- **Green (Available)**: Seats you can select for your attendance times
- **Blue with checkmark (Your Seat)**: The seat you've currently reserved
- **Gray (Occupied)**: Seats reserved by others during your attendance times

### Step 4: Select Your Seat

**Using the Visual Floorplan:**
1. Look at the floorplan image showing the room layout
2. Seats appear as circular markers on the floorplan
3. Click on an available (green) seat marker
4. The seat will turn blue and show a checkmark

**Using the List View:**
1. Scroll through the list of seat buttons below the floorplan
2. Click on an available seat button
3. You'll see a success message confirming your reservation

### Step 5: Manage Your Reservation

**To Change Your Seat:**
- Simply click on a different available seat
- Your reservation will automatically update

**To Remove Your Reservation:**
- Click the "Remove" button in the green alert box showing your current seat
- Your seat will be released for others to reserve

## Important Notes

### Attendance Time Changes

⚠️ **Important**: If you change your attendance times (the time periods you selected in the RSVP section), your seat reservation will be automatically removed. This is because:

- Seat reservations are tied to specific time periods
- Changing times may affect seat availability
- This prevents blocking seats during times you won't be attending

**After changing attendance times:**
1. The system will show you which seats are available for your new times
2. Select a new seat (your previous seat may not be available)

### Double-Booking Prevention

The system prevents double-booking:

- You cannot select a seat that someone else has reserved for overlapping times
- If you try to select an occupied seat, you'll see an error message
- The list automatically hides occupied seats so you can only click available ones

### Accessibility Features

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Press Tab to move between seats
- Press Enter or Space to select a highlighted seat
- All seats have descriptive labels for screen readers

**Mobile Use:**
- Tap targets are sized for easy touch selection (minimum 44x44 pixels)
- The layout adapts to your screen size
- Both floorplan and list views work on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### "Please select your RSVP and attendance times above"

You need to:
1. Set your handle
2. Choose Yes or Maybe for RSVP
3. Select at least one attendance time period

### "This seat is already reserved"

The seat you tried to select is occupied during your attendance times. Try:
1. Selecting a different seat (green ones are available)
2. Changing your attendance times if you're flexible
3. Choosing an unspecified seat if the option is available

### "No rooms or seats have been configured"

The event organizer hasn't set up seating yet. Contact them if you believe this is an error.

### Seat disappeared after changing times

When you change attendance times, your seat reservation is removed. This is by design:
1. Your old reservation may conflict with your new times
2. Different seats may be available for different time periods
3. Select a new seat after confirming your new attendance times

## Tips

- **Select your seat early**: Popular seats fill up fast
- **Check the floorplan**: If available, use it to see the actual room layout
- **Consider your preferences**: Front, back, near windows, near outlets, etc.
- **Coordinate with friends**: You can see which seats are taken but not who has them
- **Keep your RSVP updated**: If plans change, update your times and re-select a seat

## Privacy

- Other attendees can see which seats are occupied but not who reserved them
- Event admins can see all seat reservations including names
- Your seat reservation is only visible to you and event administrators

## Questions?

If you have issues with seat selection:

1. Try refreshing the page

3. Contact the event organizer
4. Report technical issues through your CaLANdar support channel
