  test('should display the events page with a title and event container', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to the events page
    // The baseURL is 'http://localhost:3000' from playwright.config.ts
    // The events page route is '/events'
    await page.goto('/events');

    // Assert page title or a key heading
    // Option 1: Check document title (if your app sets it dynamically)
    // await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/CaLANdar/); // Assuming app name is CaLANdar

    // Option 2: Check for a prominent heading on the page.
    // Let's assume there's an H1 or a specific data-testid for the page title.
    // For now, we'll look for a generic heading that might contain "Events".
    // This is a placeholder; a more specific selector is better.
    const heading = page.locator('h1, h2, [data-testid="page-title"]'); // Adjust selector
    // It's hard to know the exact text without seeing the page,
    // but we can expect it to be visible as a basic check.
    await expect(heading.first()).toBeVisible(); 
    // A more specific text check would be:
    // await expect(heading.filter({ hasText: /Events|Upcoming Events|Event Selection/i }).first()).toBeVisible();


    // Check for an events list container
    // This selector needs to be specific to your application's structure.
    // Let's assume EventSelection.tsx renders a main container for event cards.
    // We'll use a placeholder selector; this would need to be updated based on actual component markup.
    // Common patterns: id="events-list", class="event-container", data-testid="events-container"
    const eventsListContainer = page.locator('main, [role="list"], [data-testid="event-selection-container"]'); // Example selectors
    await expect(eventsListContainer.first()).toBeVisible();

    // Basic check for event data:
    // Assert that a "No events" message is NOT visible, or an event card IS visible.
    // This depends on how EventSelection.tsx handles empty states.
    // Let's assume if there are events, some element with a common test ID appears.
    // And if not, a "no events" message might appear.

    // Scenario 1: Expecting at least one event or no "no events" message.
    const noEventsMessage = page.getByText(/No events found/i); // Adjust if text is different
    const eventCard = page.locator('[data-testid="event-card"]').first(); // Example selector for an event card

    // We expect either an event card to be visible OR the "no events" message to NOT be visible.
    // This is a bit tricky without knowing the default state.
    // A simpler first assertion: the main container is there (already done above).

    // For a very basic check, we can try to see if the "No events found" message is NOT present.
    // This implies *something* is there, or the loading state is different.
    // This might be flaky if the page loads asynchronously and briefly shows no events.
    // await expect(noEventsMessage).not.toBeVisible();

    // A slightly more robust check might be to wait for either an event or the "no events" message.
    // For now, just checking the container's visibility is a good first step.
    // Further checks (like for event cards) would require more knowledge of the EventSelection component's output
    // and potentially mocking API responses if it makes live calls.
