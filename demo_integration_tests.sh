echo "🚀 CaLANdar API Integration Test Demonstration"
echo "============================================="
echo

echo "📋 Prerequisites:"
echo "  ✅ Nix development environment"
echo "  ✅ PostgreSQL database (via Shuttle)"
echo "  ✅ Integration test suite implemented"
echo

echo "🔧 Test Infrastructure:"
echo "  • Mock servers for Steam API and email service"
echo "  • Real database operations via Shuttle"
echo "  • Comprehensive authentication testing framework"
echo "  • Complete API workflow coverage"
echo

echo "📊 Test Coverage:"
echo "  1. Admin authentication and operations"
echo "  2. Game database updates"
echo "  3. Event creation and management"
echo "  4. Guest invitations and notifications"
echo "  5. User authentication and profile management"
echo "  6. Steam games import and synchronization"
echo "  7. Event RSVP functionality"
echo "  8. Game suggestions and voting"
echo "  9. Data cleanup and teardown"
echo

echo "🎯 Full Integration Test Workflow:"
echo "  To run the complete integration test suite:"
echo
echo "  Terminal 1:"
echo "    cd /path/to/caLANdar"
echo "    nix develop --impure"
echo "    just dev-api"
echo
echo "  Terminal 2:"
echo "    cd /path/to/caLANdar"  
echo "    nix develop --impure"
echo "    just test-integration"
echo
echo "  Or run specific tests:"
echo "    cargo test test_complete_api_workflow -- --ignored"
echo

echo "📚 Documentation:"
echo "  • Full test documentation: api/tests/README.md"
echo "  • Test implementation: api/tests/integration_test.rs"
echo "  • Mock strategies and setup details included"
echo

echo "🎉 Integration Test Suite Summary:"
echo "  ✅ Comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing"
echo "  ✅ Real database integration via Shuttle"
echo "  ✅ External service mocking (Steam API, email)"
echo "  ✅ Authentication and authorization testing"
echo "  ✅ Fast and reliable test execution"
echo "  ✅ Clear documentation and usage instructions"
echo "  ✅ CI-ready test infrastructure"
